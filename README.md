# Practicum
This practicum was designed to test some of your UI skills including: css and scss, animations within an existing Angular project, and some basic Github skills. 

## Part 1: Setting up your working environment 
1. First you need to create a new GitHub **private** repository 
2. Next, please **duplicate** this repository to your newly created one
   you can follow these instructions how to [duplicate a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository)
  
    (Do **not** fork. If you do you will not be able to change the repo to _private_)

### How to submit
**For each task you complete create new pull request**.
To do so you will need to create a new branch for every part. We suggest to name the branchs something like `task-<N>\<...name...>`.

when you are done create a **pull request (in GitHub) for each of the branchs above** that we will be use to review and discuss your work. 
**Do not merge the pull requests!** 

## Part 2: Practicum
Follow the instructions within the app.
We will score for css skill, creativity and best practices.
Feel free to leave comments explaining your choices in the code.

## When you done
Please give dominique@blockchaingroup.io and nathan.braslavski@blockchaingroup.io
access to your private repo.
**And send us an email with the link to your repositry.**

## Development server
Start by installing all the dependencies with `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
